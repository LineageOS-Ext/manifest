Getting Started
---------------


To get started with Android/LightOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the LightOS trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/BAProductions/LightOS.git -b lineage-16.0

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
