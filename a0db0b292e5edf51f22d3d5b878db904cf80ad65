I guess an admin of that repo needs to do that with the state of commit 661c183e19d3a6848a046f1db973f5725c7f2204/tag android-10.0.0_r45 of https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/zlib",

      "message": "The lineage-17 branches have received at least ASB updates until February 2023, see https://review.lineageos.org/q/topic:Q_asb_2023-02\nThis is seemingly when Google stopped providing backports to Android 10, i.e. 2023-02 is the last ASB that mentions updates to Android 10, 2023-03 starts at Android 11.\nHence I did the work manually backporting the ASB updates from LineageOS 18 to 17 as per https://review.lineageos.org/q/topic:R_asb_2023-03\nThe 2023-03 ASB mentions a bug in ZLIB with CVE-2023-20966 hence I also backported that at https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_external_zlib/+/352570 but this needs a corresponding branch in the LOS fork to target that.\n\nWere you referring to that or did you mean another patch/patches are missing from ZLIB?\n\nThe lineage-17.1 branch in https://github.com/LineageOS/android_external_zlib is new and contains the latest commit used from upstream for android-10: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/zlib/+log/661c183e19d3a6848a046f1db973f5725c7f2204\nI found that used after a `repo sync` and verified that there were no further changes for android-10\n\nDoes this clear your issue?",
